# Ilnar Gazizov

## About me

Note:

My name is Ilnar. I'm ethnically Tatar, and I lived in Kazan my whole life. I am a software engineering student at ITIS, KFU.

I've been programming for at least six years. I've written programs on a lot of different languages during that time, but now I mainly use C#, Python and C++. I've made several applications for different platforms, such as a desktop video editor, an article reader for an Android and a small web-forum, along with many other projects and games. My passion for programming I mostly own to Yandex Lyceum, which I graduated with great honours. I've also taken part in numerous programming competitions and was lucky enough to win some of those.

I guess it's quite clear now that coding is how I usually spend my pastime. Also, I like to listen to and compose music, play on a piano and learn new programming languages and techniques by reading books and articles. 

Question time:
- What is my nationality?
- Can you name at least one of my projects?
- Do I even have some hobbies outside programming?
